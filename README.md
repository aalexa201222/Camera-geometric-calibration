# Camera Geometric Calibration
![alt text](https://github.com/aalexa201222/Camera-geometric-calibration/calibration.jpg?raw=true)
## Overview

This project implements geometric camera calibration using Python and OpenCV. It's designed to calibrate cameras based on images of a chessboard captured under different orientations and positions. This calibration is crucial for accurate 3D reconstructions and computer vision applications.

## Key Features
- **Automated and Manual Corner Detection**: Utilizes both automatic corner detection and a manual interface for cases where automatic detection fails.
- **Multiple Calibration Runs**: Supports different calibration scenarios to assess the impact of using varying numbers and qualities of images.
- **3D Projection in Real-Time**: Visualizes 3D objects in real-time using calibrated camera parameters.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **OpenCV**: Needed for all image processing and camera calibration functionalities.


## Installation
